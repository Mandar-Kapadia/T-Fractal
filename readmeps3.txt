Your name: Mandar Kapadia

Hours to complete assignment: 5 hours

/**********************************************************************
 *  Briefly discuss the assignment itself and what you accomplished.
 **********************************************************************/
    In this program we had to make Triangle Fractals with Recursive functions
    and a class that would draw the diffrent Triangles. 


 /**********************************************************************
 *  Discuss one or more key algorithms, data structures, or 
 *  OO designs that were central to the assignment.
 **********************************************************************/
    int this I used a Recursive algo with would see if the depth was 0 if not 
    then it would simply just go through until it was one and then print diffrent 
    lines that would make lines. I used the vertex array data structures to store vertexs
    for the points;


/**********************************************************************
 *  Briefly explain the workings of the features you implemented.
 *  Include code excerpts.
 **********************************************************************/
I implemented color and added music when it displays the finished product as 
a feature by sf::Music music;
     if(!music.openFromFile("Rocky_theme_song.wav")){
       return(-1);
     }
     music.setLoop(1);
     music.play();
   
   and I add color by changed the color for each vertex.


 /**********************************************************************
 *  Briefly explain what you learned in the assignment.
 **********************************************************************/
In this assignment I learned about how to implemented vertex arrays and use diffrent 
sfml librays also with learn how to use Recursive functions effectivy.  


/**********************************************************************
 *  List whatever help (if any) you received from the instructor,
 *  classmates, or anyone else.
 **********************************************************************/
I got help from erik a little bit in the program.


/**********************************************************************
 *  Describe any serious problems you encountered.  
 *  If you didn't complete any part of any assignment, 
 *  the things that you didn't do, or didn't get working.                  
 **********************************************************************/
I didnt have a major problem but i wasnt getting the right length but i used some 
math to figure it out.


/**********************************************************************
 *  List any other comments here.
